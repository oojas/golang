	// By default Go doesn't work with call by reference . It works with call by value i.e..
	// it creates copies of arrays and not edits the values of the initial array.
	// if you don't want to copy the data into another array then use & function so that it gives the
	// address of the initial array.
	// So here the concept of pointers comes into play.
